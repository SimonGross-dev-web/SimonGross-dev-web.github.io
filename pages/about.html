<h1>Pillows will never be the same</h1>
<h2>A new way to sleep</h2>
<p>I am tired of waking up hot in the middle of the night. My pillow is always warm and uncomfortable for my head. It feels like even turning over my pillow does nothing. There has to be a better way!</p>
<p>The cooling pillow prevents this disaster, keeping your head and face cool throughout the night. No more overheating and sweating. You can sleep calmly knowing the pillow will keep you cool.</p>
