  <h1>Our Story</h1>
  <img src="/images/beanman.jpg" alt="A photo of our owner, Charlie, from a getty images shoot he did in our farm">
  <p>Charlie is a humble bean farmer from rural Columbia, who founded Mountain Bean Cafe. Growing up on a coffee farm, he learned a lot about what good coffee should look and taste like. He loved the rich flavors of columbia and the roasting from his father's farm. When he came to Colorado, however, Charlie was shocked by the lack of quality roasts.</p>
  <p>Charlie began Mountain Bean Cafe as a way to bring the flavors he loved from Columbia to Colorado. Our amazing roasts bring rich flavor and an amazing taste. Quality roasts for the quality views!</p>
